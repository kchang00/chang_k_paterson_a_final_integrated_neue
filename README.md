TASKS:

Kayla: 
- Fix weird padding on gallery filter
- Finish filter (dropdown menus with CSS?)
- Add document outline
- Fix weird placement of images because of position:absolute...

- practice changing layout

TIPS for Editing Flex Layout:

- Remove code at beginning commented as "demo" code (removes black boxes and white text)
- Line height defined in <p>
- Then remove label in html
